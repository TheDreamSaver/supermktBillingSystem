# supermktBillingSystem
The project is on Supermarket Billing. Supermarket is the place  where customers come to purchase their daily using products and pay for  that. So there is a need to calculate how many products are sold and to  generate the bill for the customer.  In our project we have 2 users. First one is the administrator who  will decide the taxes and commissions on the products and can see the  report of any product. He is the one who will decide the products  available for customers. The second one is the customer or the billing  manager who can purchase the items available or can make the bill for the  customers.  This project can also be used for online purchasing as the customer  can access it easily.
